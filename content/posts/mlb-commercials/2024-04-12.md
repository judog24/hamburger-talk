title: "Ohtani Hype: Ohtani Ties Japanese-born Home Run Record"

I sure was right about missing the Angerls and Dodgers games on Wednesday. I sort of missed the games tonight. I tuned into the start of the Angels game and watched a bizarre first inning where the Red Sox kept making errors which gave the Angels an early lead. A few innings later, I saw Rendon get a hit and Schanuel get an RBI to make the game 5-0 before shifting my focus entirely to the Coachella live streams on YouTube. I will be attending the festival next weekend. To my surprise, the Angels were able to hold onto the lead and win the game with a 7-0 shutout.

The only other glimpse of baseball I saw today was a few innings of the Dodgers game during dinner. Ohtani got a home run. Incredible. This home run makes him tied for the most home runs by a Japanese-born player. I expect that he will get his 176th career home run to dethrone Hideki Matsui by next weekend. Imagine if he gets it with an inside the park home run.

The Dodgers game had a banner ad saying that four more strikeouts would result in free Jumbo Jacks. I wonder if they were able to pull it off. There sure was enough time to do it. The box score says the game went into the 11th inning.

I may have fallen victim to Carl's Jr. advertising last night. You really can get a Spicy Western Bacon Cheeseburger for just five dollars in the app.
