Between the Angels game, Svengoolie, Formula 1 and Saturday Night Live, it is going to be a busy night. I am sure I missed a bunch of commercials. Disappointing news about Schanuel's streak being retroactively ended due to a scoring change to a game that was played a week ago. The Angels won at least. Time for racing? The Japanese Grand Prix is currently in a red flag as I write this.
