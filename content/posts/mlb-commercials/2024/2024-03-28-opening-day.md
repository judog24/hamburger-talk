title: "MLB Opening Day: Mike Trout Smashes Ball, Jack in the Box Smashes Burger"

Today marks one of the most exciting days in baseball, opening day. Unless you are the Dodgers or Padres who played a couple of games in South Korea last week, these are the first games of the regular season. Opening day was off to a very strong start for Angels fans when Mike Trout hit a home run in the first inning, marking the first home run hit for any team this year. The early lead soon fell apart in a way that is not unfamiliar to Angels fans. The Angels lost 3-11 to the Orioles. At least I can say it was not as bad as the Rockies giving up 14 runs in one inning to the Arizona Diamondbacks. Baseball is officially back and I am prepared to watch as much of the 162 Angels games as I can. Will my sanity handle all of the fast food commercials that seem to play nonstop?

Viewers of Bally Sports will be quick to realize that Jack in the Box and Carl's Jr. spend on a lot of money on advertising. It felt like nearly every break last season contained an advertisement for Carl's Jr. I jokingly sent a message to my brother during the last Spring training game against the Dodgers asking if I should keep a tally of how many fast food commercials I watch this year. He said it would be a statistic he would be interested knowing. I have started to keep a [live log on Mastodon](https://cheddarcrackers.club/@baseballfastfoodcommercials) of the fast food commercials I watch this baseball season.

I don't know if it has anything to do with the game being broadcasted at noon instead of a typical 6:38 PM time slot, but the number of fast food commercials that I saw during the Angels game today was surprisingly low. I saw more fast food commercials when I flipped the channel to Spectrum SportsNet LA for a few moments to watch the Ohtani at-bats. There was a solid hour during the Angels game where I did not see a single fast food commercial.

A commercial break during the middle of the fifth inning marked the first time I saw a full fledged commercial for a fast food restaurant on Bally Sports. Jack in the Box ran two commercials for its Smashed Jack burger during that break. Leading up to that were two banner ads in the bottom of the second and third innings, which I am going to count as a separate category. Flipping the channel to SportsNet LA to watch Ohtani greeted me to two Carl's Jr. commercials. Overall, these numbers were way lower than I was expecting.

## The Breakdown

### Bally Sports West

| Restaurant | Commercials | Banners |
| ---------- | :-----------: | :-------: |
|Jack in the Box | 2 | 2 |
