Between an early afternoon birthday party and Coachella live streams, I thought I had missed baseball for the day. While waiting for No Doubt to take the stage after Blur, I decided to check in on Ohtani and was pleasantly surprised to see the game was only in the second inning at 8:40 PM.

I watched about twenty minutes of baseball and saw a mid-game Carl's Jr. commercial and a commercial for Del Taco. I didn't bother logging them on Mastodon. I was trying to eat dinner before watching Coachella live streams the rest of the night. I am surprised it took this long to see a Del Taco commercial during a baseball game. It is a restaurant that I usually see commercials for on other channels.

I will probably be disappointed by Bally Sports not showing a replay of a 10 AM baseball game tomorrow. The Dodgers game is at a time that potentially conflicts with some Coachella live streams I want to watch, but I feel more confident about Spectrum SportsNet LA repeating the game.
