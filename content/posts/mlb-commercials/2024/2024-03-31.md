The Angels earned their first win of the season. It was a busy morning so I missed most of the game. I just don't understand Bally Sports' habit of not rebroadcasting Sunday games on Sunday. The game started at 10:30 AM here, there is probably room on the schedule to show it at least one more time in a more traditional time slot.

There was a Dodgers game on ESPN this afternoon. We aren't even a full week into the season and we are already on our third outlet broadcasting a Dodgers game. Could you imagine if Saturday's game was shown on Fox? What a mess. I paid very little attention to this game. I was still busy. This is a good reminder that this project is tracking the amount of fast food commercials I watch and not how many were actually shown.

My divided attention is reflected in the number of commercials I watched. I have a strong feeling that Bally Sports showed more than one commercial for Jack in the Box.

## The Breakdown

### Bally Sports West

| Restaurant | Commercials | Banners |
| ---------- | :-----------: | :-------: |
|Jack in the Box | 1 | 1 |

### Overall Total This Season

|El Pollo Loco | 2 | 0 |
|Jack in the Box | 7 | 4 |
