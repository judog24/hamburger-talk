title: "Angels Play 10,000th Regular Season Game"

It has been six days since I have watched baseball. I caught up on some baseball news that I missed while I was at Coachella this weekend. Ohtani broke the record for most home runs by a Japanese-born player. I am disappointed that I missed it, but I am glad it finally happened. Nine days without a home run feels like a long time. The Angels started a losing streak. Anthony Rendon made headlines again. He is on the IL. Classic Rendon.

Tonight was a milestone game for the Angels. If only the 10,000th regular season game was more memorable. Reid Detmers gave up a home run in the second inning and the game went downhill from there. There was potential in the bottom of the 9th for a Mike Trout walk-off grand slam, but it didn't happen. The losing streak was extended to its fifth game.

I had some stuff that I needed to do tonight so I had the game on as background noise up until the 7th inning. There was a commercial for Jimmy John's. That was different.
